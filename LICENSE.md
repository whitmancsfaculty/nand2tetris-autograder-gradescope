Request from the Nand2Tetris Authors:
-------------------------------------
We developed this course and made all its materials freely available because we want to help people learn applied computer science on their own terms. We believe that students and self-learners who set out to do the hardware and software projects should have the benefit and challenge of doing original work, without seeing published solutions. 

Therefore, we request that you don't post solutions publicly on the web, e.g. in blogs, forums, or Github-like places. If your course instructor or organizer creates a private space in which work can be shared outside the public domain, that's fine. Likewise, you can share your work with others using a password-protected space, if it's permitted by the specific course in which you are enrolled. 

Please use your judgment and help ensure that many more students, like you, will not be denied the thrill of original work and self-discovery. Thx – Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken
